Requirements for building POLUtils
==================================

Main requirement is Visual Studio 2008. I think Visual C# Express 2008 is not enough (I don't think it does 64-bit builds).
A command-line Subversion client (svn.exe) needs to be in Visual Studio's executables path (either in the global PATH or specified via
Tools>Options, Projects and Solutions, VC++ Directories, Executable files) for the build to work (the current revision number is embedded
in the POLUtils executable). Convenient MSI packages (both for 32-bit and 64 bit) can be retrieved from http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download.

Building the installer requires NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/).

For building the translator kit, more GNU tools will be required (at least bash and awk). Advanced use only.

See also CODING.txt for coding and style guidelines, if you want to modify the code.
